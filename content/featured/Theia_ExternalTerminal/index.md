I authored @theia/external-terminal - a npm package that contributes the ability to spawn external terminals from the Electron version of Theia. The extension includes the logic to spawn appropriate terminal application for each operating system (Windows, Linux, OSX).

The extension has nearly 2000 downloads weekly.
